## andor

It's a very customized workflow to monitor a remote server. It's launched with `andor` keyword and it shows some information about the remote machine:

- CPU frequency.
- Memory usage.
- Disk usage.
- CPU load.

> I know it's quite difficult to adapt it to common cases since it's based on a concrete API.
